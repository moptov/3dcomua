#CKEditor plugin: Dragable image resizing for Webkit

This plugin implements draggable image resizing in Webkit-based browsers (Chrome/Safari). The feature already
exists in Internet Explorer and Firefox as a built-in browser capability but not in Webkit. So if you or your
website's users are used to seeing the small drag-to-resize handles at the corner of images, but use Chrome
or Safari, install this plugin to get it back (with a few bonus features).

##Features:
 * Shows semi-transparent overlay while resizing
 * Enforces Aspect Ratio (unless holding shift)
 * Snap to size of other images in editor (optional)
 * Escape while dragging cancels resize

I have implemented this feature in pure JavaScript with no external dependencies. It only activates if a Webkit
browser is detected and it has been tested in most recent versions of Chrome and Safari on PC and Mac.

Please, if you notice any bugs, open an issue in the [issue tracker](ck-webkitdrag/issues).
